JWT_SECRET=dev-secret-key-change-in-production
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
```

### Production (.env)
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/ecommerce

## Database Setup

### Create Indexes
```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongo your-production-database

# Verify indexes exist
db.users.getIndexes()
db.orders.getIndexes()
db.products.getIndexes()
```

### Expected Output
```
Users indexes:
  _id_, email_1, createdAt_-1, role_1, email_1_role_1

Orders indexes:
  _id_, user_1_createdAt_-1, status_1_createdAt_-1, 
  paymentStatus_1, createdAt_-1, orderNumber_1

Products indexes:
  _id_, name_text_description_text_tags_text,
  category_1_price_1, productId_1, featured_1_active_1,
  createdAt_-1, price_1, stock_1
```

### Verification Steps
- [ ] All indexes created
- [ ] No duplicate indexes
- [ ] Query performance tested
- [ ] Explain plans reviewed

---

## Server Configuration

### Node.js
```bash
# Verify Node version
node --version  # Should be v14+

npm ci --production

# Build frontend
npm run build
```

### PM2 (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Install PM2 globally
npm install -g pm2

# Start with cluster mode
pm2 start server/server.js -i 4 --name "ecommerce"

# Enable startup on reboot
pm2 startup
pm2 save

# Monitor
pm2 logs
pm2 monit
```

### Docker (Alternative)
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t ecommerce:latest .

# Run container
docker run -d \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -e MONGO_URI="mongodb://..." \
  -e JWT_SECRET="..." \
  ecommerce:latest

# Verify
docker logs ecommerce
```

---

## Monitoring Setup

### Application Monitoring
```javascript
