    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Makhana contains about 9-10% protein, making it an excellent plant-based protein source for vegetarians and vegans.

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Rich in Antioxidants</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
