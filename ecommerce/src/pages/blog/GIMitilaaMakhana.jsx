      At Makhaantraafoods PVT. LTD., we believe that great food tells a story of where it comes from. That is why we source our makhana exclusively from the GI-tagged Mithila region. In a world full of generic snacks, Mithila makhana stands out as a symbol of purity, tradition, and a standard of quality that you can actually taste.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Exactly is GI-Tagged Mithila Makhana?</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Think of a Geographical Indication (GI) tag as a birth certificate for food. Just as Champagne only comes from France, true Mithila Makhana only comes from the sun-drenched wetlands of North Bihar—places like Madhubani and Darbhanga.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      The region's unique soil and water give this makhana its signature pearl size, superior crunch, and incredible nutritional profile. The GI tag is a legal promise: it ensures that what you are buying is the real deal, grown using time-honored methods that haven't changed for generations. For our buyers, it's the ultimate guarantee of authenticity.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why This Matters for Your Business</h2>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Magic of Mithila's Traditional Farming</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      There is a certain magic in the wetlands of Mithila that modern machinery just can't replicate. The makhana is still harvested by hand from shallow ponds, sun-dried, and popped using techniques passed down through families for centuries.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      This tradition is why Bihar is home to the finest makhana in India, supplying major hubs from Delhi and Mumbai to Bangalore and Surat. By sourcing directly from these local farming belts, Makhaantraafoods ensures that the integrity of the pond stays intact all the way to the package.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Taking Mithila to the World</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      The world is waking up to the benefits of makhana, and the GI tag helps it compete on the global stage. From the USA and UAE to Australia and Canada, Mithila makhana is being recognized as one of the best 'clean-label' snacks in the world. We take pride in being the bridge that brings this ancient Indian superfood to global markets through hygienic processing and export-ready packaging.
